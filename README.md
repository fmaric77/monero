# Monero Payment Processor

A Next.js application for processing Monero payments with a custodial wallet system.

## Features

- Account registration with Monero public address
- Master custodial wallet with accounts per user (efficient and professional)
- Account assignment (managed by localhost app)
- Payment request creation and status tracking
- Balance management
- Webhook notifications for payment completion
- RESTful API with API key authentication
- **Testnet Support**: Separate testnet and mainnet environments with complete isolation

## Architecture

The system consists of two main components:

1. **Vercel App** (This repository): Next.js API that handles account management, payment tracking, and provides public APIs
2. **Localhost App (Mediator)**: Monero node that manages a master custodial wallet, assigns accounts to users, monitors blockchain, and pushes updates to Vercel

### Master Wallet Architecture

- **Single Master Wallet**: All users share one master custodial wallet file
- **Account-Based System**: Each user gets an account index (0, 1, 2, ...)
- **Subaddresses**: Each account can have multiple subaddresses for payments
- **Efficient**: One wallet refresh instead of N refreshes
- **Scalable**: Accounts are lightweight compared to individual wallets

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- MongoDB database
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create `.env.local` file:
   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
   INTERNAL_API_SECRET=your-shared-secret-for-localhost-app
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
   PAYMENT_EXPIRATION_HOURS=24
   WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT_MS=5000
   WEBHOOK_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3
   ```
   
   **Note:** The mediator runs locally and cannot be accessed from Vercel. Subaddresses are generated asynchronously by the mediator within ~30 seconds of payment creation.

## Testnet Support

The system supports both testnet and mainnet with complete isolation:

- **Separate API Keys**: Users get different API keys for testnet vs mainnet (completely separate user accounts)
- **Separate Databases**: Different MongoDB databases for testnet/mainnet
- **Network Selection**: Determined by the `testnet` flag when creating an account

### Creating Testnet Accounts

When creating an account via `POST /api/account`, include `testnet: true` in the request body:

```json
{
  "publicKey": "your-testnet-public-key",
  "password": "your-password",
  "testnet": true
}
```

The response will include the `testnet` flag:

```json
{
  "apiKey": "your-api-key",
  "publicKey": "your-testnet-public-key",
  "accountIndex": 0,
  "testnet": true
}
```

### Running Separate Mediator Processes

Run separate mediator processes for mainnet and testnet:

**Mainnet:**
```bash
MONERO_TESTNET=false MONGO_URI=mongodb://.../monero_mainnet npm start
```

**Testnet:**
```bash
MONERO_TESTNET=true MONGO_URI=mongodb://.../monero_testnet npm start
```

See `monero-mediator/.env.mainnet.example` and `monero-mediator/.env.testnet.example` for configuration examples.

4. Run development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## API Endpoints

### Public APIs (Require API Key)

- `POST /api/payments` - Create payment request (subaddress generated asynchronously by mediator)
- `GET /api/payments/:id` - Check payment status (includes subaddress once generated by mediator)
- `GET /api/payments/:id/subaddress` - Not available (mediator is local, use GET /api/payments/:id instead)
- `GET /api/balance` - Get account balance
- `GET /api/account` - Get account information
- `POST /api/webhooks` - Configure webhook URL

### Internal APIs (Require Shared Secret)

- `POST /api/internal/payment-update` - Update payment status
- `POST /api/internal/balance-update` - Update user balance
- `POST /api/internal/payment-create` - Create payment with address
- `GET /api/internal/users-without-account` - Get users needing account assignment
- `POST /api/internal/assign-account` - Assign account index to user

See `/docs` page for complete API documentation.

## Database Schema

### User Model
- `publicKey` - User's Monero public address (unique per network)
- `accountIndex` - System-assigned account index in master wallet (nullable, unique per network)
- `passwordHash` - Hashed password
- `apiKey` - API key for authentication (unique)
- `balance` - XMR balance in atomic units (calculated from transfers to user's subaddresses)
- `webhookUrl` - Optional webhook URL for notifications
- `testnet` - Boolean flag indicating testnet (default: false)

### Payment Model
- `paymentId` - Unique payment identifier (UUID)
- `userId` - Reference to User
- `amount` - Payment amount in atomic units
- `status` - Payment status (pending/completed/expired/failed)
- `transactionHash` - Monero transaction hash (optional)
- `expiresAt` - Payment expiration timestamp
- `testnet` - Boolean flag indicating testnet (inherited from user)

**Note:** Subaddresses are stored separately by the mediator and linked by `paymentId`. They are returned in API responses but not stored in the Payment model.

### How It Works

1. **User Registration**: User creates account with public key
2. **Account Assignment**: Mediator assigns next available account index (0, 1, 2, ...)
3. **Payment Creation**: User creates payment request
4. **Subaddress Generation**: Mediator generates unique subaddress for user's account
5. **Payment Monitoring**: Mediator monitors master wallet, filters transfers by account/subaddress
6. **Balance Calculation**: User balance calculated from transfers to their account's subaddresses

## Deployment

Deploy to Vercel:

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Import project in Vercel
3. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy

## Security Notes

- API keys are stored in plain text (consider hashing for production)
- Private keys for the master custodial wallet are NEVER stored in this app
- Master wallet is managed securely by the localhost mediator app
- All webhook URLs must use HTTPS
- Internal APIs are protected by shared secret
- Each user's funds are isolated by account index and subaddresses
